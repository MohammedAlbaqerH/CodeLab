## Assignment 04/
-For this assignment, you will be using 2 different classification datasets and create a fully connected (Dense) neural network to predict the output based on the input features.

-The goal of this assignment is to get you used to using TensorFlow to build models. You don't need to worry about cross validation and hyper parameters tuning (except for the network size/depth).

### DATASETS:

-You will be using the following datasets from Scikit Learn:

-`datasets.load_iris`

-`datasets.load_wine`
